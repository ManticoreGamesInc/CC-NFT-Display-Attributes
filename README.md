## Finding the Component

This component can be found under the **CoreAcademy** account on Community Content.

## Overview

The NFT Display Attributes component will display the attributes of an NFT in the UI. Attributes are a great way to create content in Core. You can read the attributes of an NFT and do something based on the attributes. For example, creating an Axe where the handle, blade, and color are stored on the Blockchain as attributes.

The example for this component will load a random NFT from the MekaVerse collection, display the NFT image, and list all the attributes. What you do with those attributes is down to your imagination. Think of them as the DNA that describes how an object is made.
